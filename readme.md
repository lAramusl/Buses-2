About: 

Buses. Everyone knows them, everyone uses them.

This project is created to make an efficent route for buses in your city.
You just need to provide the number of crossroads in your city, and the amount of time for a bus to
cross the streets of the crossroad.

Our programm also provides the following functionality:

    * adding a new bus to the system

    * adding streets between crossroads

    * getting details of any neccessary bus
